# Code-Challenge-1# Code Challenge 1 

## Description
This repository contains three simple JavaScript command-line programs designed to solve everyday Kenyan utility calculations:

1. **Chai Ingredients Calculator** - Calculates the required ingredients to make a given number of cups of Kenyan chai.
2. **Boda Boda Fare Calculator** - Estimates the fare for a boda boda ride based on the distance traveled.
3. **Transaction Fee Estimator** - Calculates transaction fees based on the amount being sent, respecting minimum and maximum fee limits.

Each program prompts the user for input and prints the results clearly in the console.
